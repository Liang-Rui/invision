## Framework selection
* Plain html + js + css file (Easy to setup but hard to extend)
* Vue.js (Good for small projects, handy to use and can be extend to larger scale)
* React.js (Larger community support, manageable by large projects, but has steep learning curve) - choose this one since I would like to pick up react

## Styling framework
* Bootstrap 5 - large community support, easy to use grid/component system, handy to customise 
* Fonts - based on the page, I decided to choose RFS font resizing engine (handy to handle responsive page automatically) and assign a font size hierarchy to titles and paragraphs.
* Global bootstrap settings - setup page theme and text weight.
